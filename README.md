# Hi, I'm Rotsteinfuchs.
I'm a random guy from Germany.
I like creating websites using HTML/CSS, I'm currently learning NextJS.
I'm currently working with [MCTorn](https://www.mctorn.de) where I create fanzy cinematic Minecraft videos.
Sometimes I use Python and Java or C++ for my Arduino.

Stuff I like:
- Firefox
- Minecraft (mostly redstone and commands) and Prism Launcher
- DaVinci Resolve (**Free** video editing software)
- Figma (For website designing)
- VSCode
- Ubuntu (I use ubuntu btw, I switched recently, and I like itüëç)

Stuff I don't like:
- Adobe
- Apple
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera / Opera GX (don't use)
